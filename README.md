# HTTP Content Parser for Weather.com

There is nothing more useful than the ability to check the weather at any time and any place, for any place. Especially in your Linux terminal, where the forecast is of paramount importance, the command to check weather should work when you use it. Only it doesn't.

Weather-parser displays the weather with a densely packed interface of necessary and unnecessary information. There was no point in knowing the dew point or the moon phase, but here you have it. Weather-parser will display the local forecast by default or access another location by manual search.
